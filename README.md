# DailyProgrammer Solutions

This is a repository of my solutions to DailyProgrammer challenges. Not all of them are on here - some of the larger solutions have their own repositories.

## Key

The three digits indicate the challenge number. The letter after that corresponds to the difficulty/challenge type (ie. Easy, Intermediate, Hard, Bonus or eXercise), optionally followed by a number if that challenge was a repeated difficulty for that week. For example, `c123i2.hs` would be the solution to the second intermediate challenge in week 123, written in Haskell.

If the file starts with `c-` and contains words rather than numbers, the solution is for an unreleased challenge.
